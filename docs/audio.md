Audio
=====

Sounds are very important. I don't want them to be added as an afterthought. Sounds are vibrations, vibrations are physics, physics simulation is the core of Torped. Physics driven audio is a natural choice for Torped and should be incorporated in the very core of the physics simulation.

Resonant frequencies
--------------------
All rigid object should have their resonant frequencies computed as a preprocessing step.
